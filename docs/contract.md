# Command contract

The executable is `semrush-cli`. Node.js 22 or newer. It does not claim the `semrush` command owned by other packages.

- `semrush-cli reports [--json]` lists the research reports and project operations.
- `semrush-cli <report-name> --<parameter> <value> [--json]` executes one report. Names and flags use hyphens. `semrush-cli <report-name> --help` shows its complete schema-derived options. Objects and arrays use JSON. Report definitions live in `src/report-catalog.json`.
- `semrush-cli auth import --cdp-url http://127.0.0.1:9234` imports an authorized existing Chromium session into Galleton. No secret-valued command arguments. Import verifies the signed-in session before storing it. Reimport explicitly replaces the CLI's own session with revision checking.
- `semrush-cli auth login` opens an isolated visible browser, waits for sign-in, and stores its cookies in Galleton. Requires a graphical desktop.
- `semrush-cli auth status [--check] [--json]` shows Galleton metadata without credentials. `--check` verifies Semrush access.
- `semrush-cli auth logout` forgets only the selected Galleton profile. It does not log out other browsers.
- `semrush-cli setup` installs Chromium. It also initializes and starts the private Galleton daemon.
- `semrush-cli mcp` runs the stdio MCP server. Stdout contains only protocol messages. MCP exposes the same operations and schemas. Mutations carry readOnlyHint=false and require confirm=true. Delete and leave carry destructiveHint=true. It cannot log in or change local configuration.
- `semrush-cli doctor [--json]` verifies Galleton, stored session, browser, and an authenticated account report.

Successful reports are `{authenticated: true, report: <underscore_name>, data: ...}`. Raw report nesting and provider totals remain visible. Integers outside JavaScript's safe range become decimal strings. Credentials are removed recursively. JSON goes to stdout; human diagnostics and errors go to stderr. No prompts in report or MCP commands. Exit codes: 0 success, 1 service/authentication/report failure, 2 invalid usage. No retries of report requests, which can consume account allowances. No automatic anonymous fallback.

Configuration: `SEMRUSH_GALLETON_URL` (literal loopback HTTP, default `http://127.0.0.1:8771`), `SEMRUSH_GALLETON_TOKEN_FILE` (default `~/.local/share/semrush-cli/galleton/api.token`), `SEMRUSH_SESSION` (default `semrush-cli`), and `SEMRUSH_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` (optional absolute Chromium path). Authentication is loaded from Galleton into a fresh, transient browser context for each CLI process or MCP server. No persistent plaintext cookie file. Cookie updates from the report browser are captured back into Galleton. Existing reference browser profiles and services are never modified.

Internal web endpoints may change. Account quotas, mobile/history permissions and product restrictions apply. Galleton cannot manufacture a renewal token. The bundled static Galleton provider stores cookies without automatic renewal. Semrush validates authentication before each report. Reimport or sign in again when the session expires. See `docs/architecture.md` for the documented daemon extension.

## Projects

Projects use the current web UI's folder IDs, not legacy SEO project IDs.
`project-create --name <name> [--domain <domain>] --confirm` creates one project.
It does not start crawls, share the project, or configure SEO tools.
`project-get --folder-id <id>` reads its metadata.
`project-update --folder-id <id> --name <name> --confirm` renames it.
The optional `--domain` adds a domain to a project that has none. Semrush rejects
changes to an existing domain, as in the web UI.
`project-delete --folder-id <id> --confirm` permanently deletes that project.
`project-leave --folder-id <id> --confirm` leaves a shared project.
`project-set-tags --folder-id <id> --tags '["client"]' --confirm` replaces its tags.
`project-pin --folder-id <id> --pinned [true|false] --confirm` changes pin state.
`project-limits`, `project-tags`, `project-check-domain --domain <domain>`,
`project-toolkits --folder-ids '["id"]'` and
`project-tools --folder-id <id> --tools '[23,31]'` read the dashboard's data.
`project-enable-seo --folder-id <id> --confirm` creates its SEO project.
`project-seo-auto-setup --folder-id <id> --confirm` starts the web UI's automatic
SEO setup, including Site Audit and Position Tracking. Account quotas apply.

Every mutation requires explicit `--confirm` or MCP `confirm:true`. Without it,
the command fails with exit 2 before opening a browser. `--dry-run` or MCP
`dry_run:true` validates and prints the exact request without authentication or
network access. Dry runs need no confirmation. IDs are decimal strings and never
arbitrary paths. No operation retries a write. The response envelope remains
`{authenticated:true, report, data}` for all completed operations.

## Keyword Strategy Builder lists

`keyword-lists` reads the current builder's paginated lists. These are distinct
from the older Saved Keywords collection exposed by `saved-keyword-lists`.
`keyword-list-create --name <name> --confirm` creates an empty regular list.
It does not generate a strategy or start clustering. Read commands inspect list
metadata, keywords, summary, tags, clustering forecast and clustering status.
Writes rename/delete a list, import/delete keywords, undo a deletion, add/remove
tags, request metric updates and explicitly start clustering.

List-scoped operations take `--basket-id` and `--owner-id`. Both come from
`keyword-lists` (`BasketID` and `Owner.ID`). Builder IDs are safe JSON integers;
the schema rejects values beyond JavaScript's exact integer range. Project
folder IDs retain their separate decimal-string contract. Keyword selections
use a JSON array of phrases plus a database flag. Advanced filters use the web
client's documented field names and preserve pagination and sort controls.

All writes require confirmation and support dry runs before authentication.
RPC previews omit runtime credentials; the browser adds them only at execution.
Only fixed catalog RPC methods are exposed. There is no arbitrary RPC command.
Clustering and metric updates consume account allowances and never run
implicitly when creating or importing into a list.

`keyword-strategy-create --name <name> --domain <domain> --confirm` explicitly
starts generation of a structured strategy. `--seed-keywords` accepts a JSON
phrase array; supply a domain, at least one seed phrase, or both. Optional
competitors and database selection match the web creation request. This consumes
the clustering allowance. It is separate from empty regular list creation so no
read or ordinary list-create command starts generation implicitly.
